        <h2>ORIGINS OF WATERCOLOUR TATTOO'S</h2>
        <p>
          During ancient times pigments from paints were made from earth substances. Plants, animals and minerals alike. For example, the popular colour Carmine Red (despite not being used anymore) was made of insect shells (red shells from the Cochineal insect). First signs of water and paint being depicted can be seen in paleolithic cave paintings and papyrus scrolls in Egyptian times. Artists have revolutionized watercolour painting and have translated it through much-modernized means. The fast drying and intense hue creates a perfect pigment for use in tattooing.

The style speaks for itself, as it resembles watercolour paintings. In watercolour tattoos, multiple shades of colour create a coherent outlook and the edges are less sharp more blended. The structure is very different from a traditional tattoo.

        <h2>TECHNIQUE AND FINISH</h2>
        <p>
            Tattooing involves the process of needles, inks, stencils and cleaning supplies. Specifically the act of dipping a needle in ink and then piercing that into the skin. Watercolour designs usually take longer than an average tattoo- due to the amount of colour and shading that is required. Some artists paint their stencils and then a pply the stencil to the clientâ€™s skin- in order to gain a more authentic appearance.</p>

        <h2>Be Mindful</h2>
        <p>
          Tattoos with less intensity and thinner lines tend to fade faster than most traditional styles- this is commonly seen with watercolour tattoos. However, that does not mean that all watercolour tattoos will fade. If your tattoo has a defined black base the likelihood of it lasting is much stronger.

Any different kind of images can be made into watercolour style. Flowers, naturistic elements are the most popular. Designs such as lettering and sharped angled shapes are not the best for people who want watercolour styled tattoos as it does not execute the design as well.</p>
