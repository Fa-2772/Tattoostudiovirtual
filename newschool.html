        <h2>STYLES OF NEW SCHOOL</h2>
        <p>As mentioned previously the influence of neo-traditional styles (Art nouveau, and Japanese aesthetics), influences the style a lot. The influence of the Japanese aesthetic stems from gaming and comic book culture. This was due to the heavy access to the internet and the influence these genres have over pop culture and western media. During the 80s graffiti had a huge influence on this style, so the use of bright colours and drop shadows and fonts were incorporated into the design. </p>
