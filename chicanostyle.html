        <h2>ORIGINS OF CHICANO STYLE</h2>
        <p>
          Chicano style and its tattoo style originated with gang culture in New Mexico: Pachuco gang. It also stemmed from Texas, California and Arizona. Tattoos in this style were created using sewing needles and Indian black ink- no use of modern tattoo guns that we have today. Themes that were common in this style were women, religion and religious symbols, flowers and skulls. Members that had a Pachucho cross were apart of a gang that depicted “middle of the fingers and thumb” It was a sign of loyalty and respect. </p>

        <h2>CULTURAL REFRENCES</h2>
        <p>The style is considered personal and experience-based. Migrants that came from Mexico and went to Texas and California were faced with discrimination and classism. This was kept the migrants from preserving their culture through generations even more. In the 40s young Chicano kids would fight against the prejudice placed against them. A famous riot by the name of “Zoot Suit Riots” created controversy over a young Latino man’s death. Soon after there was a decline in the Pachuco gang life and there was a new stylistic approach that was evolving within the new generation. LA tattoo artists (Chicano) drew from their own life experiences, violence, women, Catholic crosses, etc. Many of these tattoo styles came from prisons and inmates would create tattoo machines from needles and thread. This style was used as self-expression and to represent the culture in physical means. </p>

        <h2>Iconography In Chicano Culture</h2>
        <p>Many of the popular designs in Chicano tattooing have concepts and meanings behind them- they are connected to the culture. Tattoos that present Pit Bulls, dice, and Lowriders or women with a ride or die sign (Cholas). There are also many clown designs (Payasas) representing the way of life as a mask- to “Laugh Now, Cry Later”. Praying hands is very popular as well and is derived from Roman Catholic symbols and saints. Religion is heavily rooted in the culture. </p>
